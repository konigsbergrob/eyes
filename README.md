<h3> Robert Konigsberg's Eyes Exercise :smile:</h3>

This repository will be used to showcase a project I completed  
during my enrollment in MIT xPRO's Professional Certificate in Coding:  
**Full Stack Development with MERN program.** :sunglasses:

**Name:** Eyes Exercise

**Description:** This was completed as part of week 8 of the program. The intention is to showcase how CSS, HTML and JS can be used, stylistically and programatically. Functionality includes moving a set of eyes to "follow" the mouse the user controls. Given the mouse position, the eyes will move accordingly

**Roadmap for Future Improvements:** I plan to change the image, slightly, depending on where the mouse is. So for example, if the mouse is at the bottom of the screen (the eyes are looking down), the screen can reflect to show a different color than if looking up. 


**Usage:** This can be used to help educate beginners about the fundamentals of web development. Albeit simple, it contains many fundamental building blocks used when coding.
